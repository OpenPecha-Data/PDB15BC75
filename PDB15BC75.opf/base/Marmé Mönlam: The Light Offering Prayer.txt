Marmé Mönlam: The Light Offering Prayer
a terma revelation of Tertön Nyima Drakpa1

In front of the vajra master, are the ‘suitable disciples’, wearing ornaments and holding kapāla
with amṛta. The vajra brothers and sisters each hold a lamp and stick of incense in their
hands. Without any doubt in your mind, consider you are actually in the presence of the
Vajra Sovereigns and their consorts, and the Noble One who Dispels the Darkness of Ignorance,
and arousing deep devotion, recite this in a melodious chant:
hung, dü sum gyalwa tamché shyukpé né
Hūṃ! You who embody all the buddhas of past, present and future,
marik mün sel pakpé lhatsok dang
Noble One who Dispels the Darkness of Ignorance, with all your deities,

Vast, ocean-like gathering of brothers and sisters:

Remaining here in this maṇḍala of supreme enlightenment,

Emanations of their wisdom mind, sons of the buddhas, holders of the teaching of the awakened
mind of bodhicitta,

Brothers and sisters, gathering of vidyādharas who share one and the same samaya,
